## What is Attrition Rate

Employee attrition, also known as employee turnover, refers to the rate at which employees leave an organization over a certain period. In a machine learning context, an employee attrition model aims to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company based on various features and historical data.

## Relevance of Employee Attrition Prediction

Cost Savings: Hiring and training new employees can be expensive. Predicting and preventing attrition can save significant costs associated with recruiting and onboarding.
Talent Retention: Understanding why employees leave can help organizations implement policies and practices to retain valuable talent.
Improved Employee Engagement: Identifying the factors that lead to attrition can help improve employee satisfaction and engagement, leading to a more productive and positive work environment.
Strategic Planning: Companies can better plan for future workforce needs and align their talent management strategies with business goals.
